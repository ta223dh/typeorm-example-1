# MongoDB testbuild with TypeORM

This project was generated by command: `npx typeorm init --name mongodb-test1 --database mongodb --docker`

The default docker image did not run on apple silicon. To fix this `docker-compose.yml` was updated
From:  `image: "mongo:5.0.12"`
To:  `image: "mongo:6.0.12"`

Run the project:

- `git clone <repo URL>`
- `cd mongodb-test1`
- `npm i`
- run docker
- `docker-compose up`
- `npm start`

The application “MongoDB Compass” was used to view the database.
